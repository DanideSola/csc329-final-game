This is my semester long project from CSC 329 - Intro to Game Programming in the Spring 2022. Our assignment was to make a game using the Unity Game Engine. We could use the Unity Asset Store or create items from scratch. 

In my game, a lumberjack comes across a cabin in the darks woods while being chased by a monster. The player must venture into the cabin's rooms, avoid bear traps, and find the light switch before the timer runs out (player has approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds). 

Button controls:

Press F - turns flashlight on and off (starts off in dark press f to see circle of light around player)
Press E - teleport rooms when near doors or edges of hallways
Press Space - swings ax
Press Q - interact with switch
Press Up arrow - moves player up
Press Down arrow - moves player down
Press Left arrow - moves player left
Press Right arrow - moves player right
Press M - mutes/unmutes background music

Interactables:

- Coin: increase player score by one
- Trap: decreases player health by one
- Pie: increases player health by one
- Board: boards on doors must be broken in order to change rooms
